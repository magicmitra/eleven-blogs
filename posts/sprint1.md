**Slice it Sprint 1**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Worked On**
- I mainly worked on the backend/server architecture last week. This week, I 
programmed and tested the authentication strategies, signup and login. All 
tests passed on postman. I also helped the design team with mock designs 
and inputs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Learned**
- I learned that there a million authentication strategies and one can employ
more than 1 strategy for one's app. But some strategies may not be compatible 
if used together. This happened this week. I had to drop one strategy, but 
its all good.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Difficult**
- Picking which passport strategy to use was the most difficult. And reading
passport's docs is terrible and borderline unuseful. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Effective About Workflow**
- What was effective was that the scrum master made a bunch of tasks at the
kanban board and we just went in swooped in tasks. We were given so much
autonomy and we werent micromanaged, we work best in this environment. Also, the 
branching workflow in our github is very effective and gives us more
productivity.
