**Slice it Sprint 3**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Worked On**
- Made the ingestion pipes more robust, creating time locks. More functions 
got programmed in the server.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Learned**
- I'm getting better at this than I was yesterday.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Difficult**
- Syncing 3 controller and syncing data can be confusing AF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Effective About Workflow**
- What was effective was that the scrum master (me) made a bunch of tasks at the
kanban board and we just went in swooped in tasks. We were given so much
autonomy and we werent micromanaged, we work best in this environment. Also, the 
branching workflow in our github is very effective and gives us more
productivity.
