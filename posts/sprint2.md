**Slice it Sprint 2**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Worked On**
- I mainly worked on the backend/server this week. I created the 
ingestion engine for slice it's server. This engine pulls from the 3rd party 
API that we have obtained and store the transformed data into our database.
I really like doing this part of the programming, this task was a subset of 
the internship experience that i had with Volkswagen. This was very fun
for me. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Learned**
- I learned to be more organized and be a better planner when it comes to 
data modeling. Hans assisted me in re-architecting one of the models due to changes
in the requirements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Difficult**
- Re-architecting the models that needs to be re-architected can be difficult
especially if it requires data reseeding and stuff.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Effective About Workflow**
- What was effective was that the scrum master made a bunch of tasks at the
kanban board and we just went in swooped in tasks. We were given so much
autonomy and we werent micromanaged, we work best in this environment. Also, the 
branching workflow in our github is very effective and gives us more
productivity.
