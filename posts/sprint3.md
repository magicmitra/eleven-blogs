**Slice it Sprint 3**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Worked On**
- I mainly worked on the backend/server while being the scrum master this week. 
I am 1.5 sprints away from completing task automation on our server, but side
projects derailed my progress. I completed bet and commenting logic in the 
backend this week. As well as exposing routes for the front end engineers to
interface with the server.

**Learned**
- I got burnt out being scrum master and assigning myself a lot of tasks LOL. 
It was inevitable as we have made a deadline which is when the NFL season starts.
I like the feeling of accomplishment when the tests in my code pass, enabling 
me to close the task and consider it finished. I also learned that my velocity
is crazy high right now, I have cranked out features in the backend this past
week in the same amount I cranked out features in a month in Aurelia/Aura. 
I am starting to feel as if Beethoven was a programmer. Im drawing parallels 
between creating his first piece ever and how better he got when he was creating
his second piece. The parallel im drawing with it is my level of skill in Aurelia and
now. You might wonder why I didnt ask for help. I have learned that getting help at this
point can be counter productive. Plenty of time wasted on discussion and conflict and
at then end of the day, you would be lucky to crank out a function. I would much rather 
just get in the zone and I prefer to work alone anyway. Thank goodness I have
great front end teamates.

**Difficult**
- Staying sane while being scrum master and doing a ton of stuff can be difficult.
But finishing it can be rewarding. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Effective About Workflow**
- What was effective was that the scrum master (me) made a bunch of tasks at the
kanban board and we just went in swooped in tasks. We were given so much
autonomy and we werent micromanaged, we work best in this environment. Also, the 
branching workflow in our github is very effective and gives us more
productivity.
